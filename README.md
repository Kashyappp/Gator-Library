# Gator-Library

GatorLibrary is a fictional library management system designed to efficiently handle book inventory, patron details, and borrowing operations using advanced data structures. This project employs a Red-Black Tree for organized book management, ensuring rapid search, addition, and deletion of records. To handle reservations, a Binary Min-Heap acts as a priority queue, organizing waitlists based on patron priority and reservation timestamps.
